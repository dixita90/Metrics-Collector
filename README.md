The application incorporates CPU stats, memory stats, Network stats. 
It helps users of the system to manage the CPU throughput, and view network and memory stats allocated to the applications. 
Keeping track of all the system metrics without a proper application is hard.

The statistics are logged into a database frequently which are analyzed and displayed to the user to keep track of system performance.
